# Streaming Service Modeling

The project entailed developing a C++ application capable of simulating a streaming platform like Netflix. It involved parsing a video database (comprising series episodes or movies) with distinct features such as ID, duration, genre, rating, and more. The project's emphasis was on utilizing object-oriented programming to efficiently organize and manipulate the data. Key object-oriented programming concepts applied include inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, method, and operator overloading, among others. The end product comprised 5 C++ programs, 1 abstract class, 3 derived/subsidiary classes, and a main application. Notably, the main application employed vector pointers for object management.

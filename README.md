# Streaming Service Modeling

## Overview 
The project entailed developing a C++ application capable of simulating a streaming platform like Netflix. It involved parsing a video database (comprising series episodes or movies) with distinct features such as ID, duration, genre, rating, and more. The project's emphasis was on utilizing object-oriented programming to efficiently organize and manipulate the data. Key object-oriented programming concepts applied include inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, method, and operator overloading, among others. The end product comprised 5 C++ programs, 1 abstract class, 3 derived/subsidiary classes, and a main application. Notably, the main application employed vector pointers for object management.

## Usage

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [C++ Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

### Installation

- Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HumbertoBM2/Streaming-Service-Modeling
    ```

- Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Streaming-Service-Modeling
    ```

### Configuration

Edit the `.txt` files in the `data` directory to customize the series episodes and movies. Ensure that you follow the existing format in the files.

## Compilation

Compile the main source file to generate the executable.

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
```
Run the compiled executable
```bash
./main.exe
```
The application will display an interactive menu guiding you through each step. Follow the prompts to navigate and enjoy the application.
